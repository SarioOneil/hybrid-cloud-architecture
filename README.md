# 🌐 Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Postgraduate Research

This repository contains the full implementation, architecture diagrams, scripts, configurations, and documentation for my postgraduate research project titled:

**“Designing and Securing Hybrid Cloud Architectures: A Practical Implementation of Multi-Cloud Infrastructure with AWS, GCP, and Azure Using Open-Source DevOps and Monitoring Tools.”**

---

## 🧠 Research Objectives

- ✅ Design a hybrid cloud architecture integrating AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- ✅ Secure and monitor the infrastructure using open-source tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Wazuh).
- ✅ Automate deployment using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.
- ✅ Analyze performance, cost, and scalability trade-offs in a hybrid cloud environment.
